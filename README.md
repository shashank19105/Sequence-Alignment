# Sequence-Alignment
Dynamic Programming algorithm to find the best possible way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

global python file is for finding global alignments and local python file is for finding local alignments. You can change your scoring scheme in the code as you wish and the program will generate a DP matrix as well as give all best possible alignments along with their calculated scores.
